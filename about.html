    Hello! <br><br>
    My name is <b>Kevin Tran</b> and I am a self taught web developer.<br>
    I am driven, I want to learn, and I will seek the answers to issues I encounter.<br><br>

    I am fixated on establishing myself as a software developer and as a result <br>
    of that, for the past 5 months, I have spent 15 hours a day, 7 days a week <br>
    relentlessly studying, researching, and working on projects. I am very strong <br>
    in both Rails in the backend along with JavaScript in the front end.<br><br>

    My stack knowledge was built on:<br>
      1) Learning Ruby and absorbing the RubyDocs<br>
      2) Using Rails to develop CRUD RESTful APIs<br>
      3) Learning Javascript and understanding its functional programming paradigm<br>
      4) Learning Backbone and going through the backbone docs<br><br>

    In addition, I researched the pitfalls of both MVC frameworks and addressed<br>
    them in my projects. Learning the 'magic' of Rails by first learning <br>
    raw SQL before using ActiveRecord, building a responsive asynchronous <br>
    interface with Backbone and properly garbage collecting ghost views, and <br>
    to marry the two (as per its intended purpose) by relegating Rails to the <br>
    API layer.
